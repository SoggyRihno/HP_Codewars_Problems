Now the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole night through,but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that he could get no rest.As when fair Juno's lord flashes his lightning in token of great rain orhail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the ground, or again as a signthat he will open the wide jaws of hungry war, even so did Agamemnon heavemany a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled within him. When he looked uponthe plain of Troy he marvelled at the many watchfires burning in frontof Ilius, and at the sound of pipes and flutes and of the hum of men, butwhen presently he turned towards the ships and hosts of the Achaeans, hetore his hair by handfuls before Jove on high, and groaned aloud for thevery disquietness of his soul. In the end he deemed it best to go at onceto Nestor son of Neleus, and see if between them they could find any wayof the Achaeans from destruction. He therefore rose, put on his shirt,bound his sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge tawnylion over his shoulders-a skin that reached his feet-and took his spearin his hand.#
